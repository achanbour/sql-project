# sql-project

Short data extraction and analysis project using SQLite data language at an introductory level.

Manipulated a database in DB Browser containing two tables with information about various contries and their populations across  years. Interesting features and trends were deducted from the data using more advanced SQL techniques such as table joins for working with multiple tables.
